    I'm a Bachelor of Arts graduate with Economics, when I'm sure about something, I go for it with full intensity.
    I still remember those conversations with my friends about how much Data Science and Analytics fascinate me,
    and the more I went into it, the more it has fascinated me.

    Currently, I am enjoying a wonderful training opportunity under the amazing mentorship of Prepleaf with the acquisition of Masai School.
    Every day is a great learning experience for me, and I feel it is helping me to become a better Analyst every day.

    I've proficient knowledge in Probability, Statistics, and Analytics with an excellent understanding of the key skills and tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, MS Excel, Predictive Modeling, Data Visualization, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Machine Learning Techniques, Multivariable Calculus, etc.

    I'm passionate about building challenging projects and excelling in their development because I get to learn a lot from it.
